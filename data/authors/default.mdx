We are a student-driven initiative connecting talents from **TUM** and **RWTH Aachen** who share a passion for data and innovation.

Our focus is on **hands-on exploration of data-driven methods**—from AI to process mining—by organizing workshops, collaborating with industry, and running student projects.

What sets us apart is our **interdisciplinary approach**: we bring together students from diverse fields to learn from each other and tackle real-world challenges where data plays a key role.

Join us if you want to:

- Work on collaborative projects with peers and industry,
- Build practical skills in data & analytics,
- Be part of an open community of curiosity and innovation.
