**TIDE** is an officially accredited **student initiative** rooted at **TUM**, dedicated to advancing **data-driven thinking** and **innovation** through practical, high-impact collaboration.

We bring together ambitious students who share an interest in **data**, **analytics**, and **emerging technologies**. While rooted in academia, our focus lies strongly on **collaboration with external partners and industry**, connecting student talent with real-world challenges.

Our work spans **hands-on workshops**, **industry collaborations**, and **student-led projects** that translate theory into practice — from **AI** and **analytics** to **process mining** and beyond. By working closely with external organizations, we create opportunities for students to gain **applied experience** while contributing meaningful solutions.

What defines us is an **interdisciplinary** and **execution-oriented** approach. We combine diverse academic backgrounds with a strong practical mindset to tackle complex problems where **data drives better decisions** and innovation.

Join us if you want to:

- Work on **real-world projects** with motivated peers and external partners
- Build practical expertise in **data, analytics, and technology**
- Grow within a **professional, curious, and ambitious community**
