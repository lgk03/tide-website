We are a dynamic student initiative formed by passionate students from RWTH Aachen and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Our group brings together diverse perspectives and expertise in the field of data analytics, with a particular focus on process mining and its applications in production and manufacturing environments.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications in the field of process mining. We explore how data-driven insights can optimize manufacturing processes, improve operational efficiency, and drive innovation in production environments.

Through regular meetings, workshops, and collaborative projects, we:

    - Share knowledge and best practices in process mining
    - Analyze real-world manufacturing processes
    - Develop practical solutions for production optimization
    - Connect with industry experts and researchers
    - Build a community of students interested in data analytics and process mining

Whether you're a student interested in data analytics, process mining, or manufacturing optimization, we welcome you to join our initiative and contribute to our growing community.
