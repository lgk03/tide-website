TIDE offers more than a place to learn — it is a platform for ambitious students who want to apply data-driven thinking in practice, grow professionally, and connect with like-minded peers.

As part of our community, you gain access to hands-on opportunities that go beyond traditional university learning. From industry talks and workshops to collaborative projects and hackathons, you can develop practical skills, strengthen your portfolio, and explore new career directions.

Joining TIDE means becoming part of a dynamic network that values initiative and collaboration. Whether you want to organize an event, start a project, or bring in new ideas and partners, we encourage members to actively shape what we build together.

Getting involved is straightforward: submit an application, and we will review it and invite you to upcoming activities. Whether your goal is to deepen existing skills or explore new fields, TIDE provides a professional environment to learn, contribute, and grow.
